    <p> Aditi Advani currently attends the University of Georgia and is working towards being a Finance major. Her goal in life is to work on Wall Street for a couple of years and eventually own her own business. She is very dedicated in school and tries to be as involved as possible.   </p>
    <p> She has had quite the interesting life and has travelled all over. She was born in Oman and then moved to Toronto, Canada. From there her life took a turn for the crazy as she then moved to St.Louis MO, Miami FL, Anchorage AK, Rochester NY, and finally Suwanee GA. Through all this moving she learned the trait of adaptability which is one of her strongest achievements.</p>
